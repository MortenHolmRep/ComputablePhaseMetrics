# ComputablePhaseMetrics

## Description
This module provides functionality to compute Computable Information Densities (CID), 
a universal indicator metric for identifying phase transitions in complex systems out of equilibrium. 
CID is a measure derived from algorithmic information theory and is used to analyze 
the structural and dynamical properties of systems undergoing phase transitions. 

The module includes methods for calculating CID values and interpreting them in the 
context of phase transition phenomena, making it a valuable tool for researchers 
studying criticality and emergent behavior in various scientific domains.

## Installation Guide

To install the package in editable mode with development dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Make sure you have `pip` installed and are in the root directory of the project before running the command.
